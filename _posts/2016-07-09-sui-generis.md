A collection of rare finds so you can enjoy, rather than dig, like a museum.

Sui Generis, our limited collection, sometimes we have 40 year old pre-revolution pu-er other times it might be a red, green or lapsang souchong. Always expect the most delightful and curious flavors you've tasted. 

Selections in this curated collection are of limited quantity.
