Philosophy on Curating 

Now, more than ever, the market is flooded with middle and low grade tea masked as imperials for extra profit. We understand because we've been at the mercy of such deception, and it was only through trial and error and bathing in puerh that we regard this essential step as the defining moment to someone finding puerh to be enjoyable or not upon the first few tries. A fake can never be real in a million ways. 

Annual production of Puerh in MengHai County of Yunnan Province alone is close to 30,000 tons, majority of it comes from trees that was cut and re-rooted post-revolution, as a result, they grow into the typical bushes you'd expect. Before the 1966 Cultural Revolution, every tea tree was a tree and not a bush, but they have been replaced by the desperate demand for food. 

Yes, Puerh is but one branch of black tea, but it is the best type of tea that evolves as it ages and medicinal properties emerge such as elevating GABA and theanine content helping to relax the nervous system, lowering of cholesterols, and stimulating blood flow for aid in weight control. 

Puerh is divided into three general grades, imperial, middle and low. The imperial grade was traditionally reserved for gifts to the emperor by the outskirt provinces, or made especially for imperial use and its tea leaves do not have a numerical grade of 1-10 like the middle and low grade does. The finest tea comes from the deeply rooted 300+ years old trees with trunks over 20cm in diameter, they absorb more nutrients and as a result obtain extra layers of flavour, complexity and medicinal values. 

Never Compromise is the reason why we can find and offer tea that makes up just one tenth of one percent of annual production.
