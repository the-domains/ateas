Symposium

The key stone of the ancient Greek society, Symposium was a place of gather, celebration and exchange of ideas. Akin to the salon in France in the 17th century, coffee house of vienna in the late 19th century.

Our box contains four servings of seven types of tea, for a total of 28\.   
Drink with friends, drink with family, drink with your heart.

Each month, tea plus optional two cigars will present itself to your doorstep in a beautifully wood crafted recycled case.

Such is life, new experiences, sometimes you are the star, sometimes you are the support, the cigars present a beautiful opportunity to underplay the tea and bring out the smoke.
