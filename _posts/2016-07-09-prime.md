Our Prime Tea
Collection pu-er has been aged in a dry storage for eight years or
more. Over time, the pungent and vibrancy of the young leaves gradually
give its way to an earthy flavor, with velvet textures and ember tones. 

Our selection - Carefully aged from exceptional young leaves, history is what our Prime tea is made of, through the gentle touch of time, and cared for by our keepers, layers of complexity and flavor is made. 

Extraordinary flavors
you would never expect from tea such as red oak, pine wood, dates, come to mind
along with hints of hand crafted honey.
