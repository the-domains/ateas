History is a funny thing, the more things change, the more they stay the same.  
- Hendrick Willem van Loon, _The Story of Mankind_ -

There was a time when artisan products were the norm, pride was taken in making a beautiful product, the community it served, our neighbors were life long customers.

It was a time when mass production was simply not possible, until it is, Industrial Revolution seemed to have the world on a fever for cheap, low quality stuff. Digital technology took Humanity to new heights as innovations in technology always does, but somehow somewhere we always look back and realize, what have we been doing?

Now the same moment has returned, expression for art as The Renaissance bought back balance to mankind during The Dark Ages. We no longer demand dollar t-shirts that are poorly made, throw away razors that simply don't work, and drinks that are fast but taste horrifying.

Out of this collective consciousness to find balance, the world found itself drawn to Michelangelo, Raphael, Da Vinci and the masters of High Renaissance, just as today we look at Apple Inc., the startups, designers, architects, and your hip new neighborhood store.

Out of this, our 150 year old family mark is reborn to bring you

the finest tea.
